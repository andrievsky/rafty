RAFTY
=====

Sometimes we try new things, sometimes we try old things, sometimes we do both.

I had a few goals in mind:

* Get hands dirty by implementing a naive version of the Raft consensus algorithm from scratch.
* Writing Go code in different terminal editors (Emacs, Vim, Micro) and pick a default one.
* Go back in time for 20 years and write code using only a terminal without autocompletion, refactoring, and other IDE features.

All goals have been achieved. ðŸ˜Š
