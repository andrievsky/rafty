RAFTY
=====

Sometimes we try new things, sometimes we try old things, sometimes we do both.

I had a few goals in mind:

* Get hands-on by implementing a naive version of the Raft consensus algorithm from scratch.
* Choose a favorite terminal editor between Emacs, Vim, and Micro.
* Go back in time 20 years and write code in the terminal without autocompletion, refactoring, and other modern IDE features.


All goals have been achieved. ðŸ˜Š
